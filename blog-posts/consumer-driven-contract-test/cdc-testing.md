E2E Testing is difficult, definitely one of the most difficult challenges within frontend development. UI tests in an integrated tend to be flaky, but depending on your risk assessment you propably want to have the confidence E2E tests provide. One fairly unknown approach to this is Consumer-Driven-Contract Testing!

This article aims to be the first point of contact in case one wants to integrate pact in an angular application. It won't cover how to integrate pact on the server-side, this is an Angular (and pact) only blog post. Additionally it will provide some guidance how to integrate this process in a proper CI pipeline, but due to the huge variety of CI tools it might be just a rough sketch for some.

This is a pretty extensive blog post, so feel free to jump to the chapter of interest.
